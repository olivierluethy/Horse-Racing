  <h3 align="center">Welcome to the Horse-Racing game!</h3>
  <p align="center">A game where you can bet on a horse without losing real money!</p>
</p>

## The story of this game
Since I love to code and develop ideas in general, I wanted to have a game where you could bet on a horse, put the bet on a horse and if you win you get more.
And of course, if you lose, you lose the bet and the money you put on it.

I started developing this game many years ago, but there were always things I wanted to improve or even add new features.
I hope you enjoy the current version!
